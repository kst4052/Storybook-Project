# Storybook-Project
This project was comprised in a group with me and 6 other people. Each student needed to create 2-3 3D models separately. When they were finished they were to use all the models in various scenes for a story book. Students were to create their own stories based off of what models were created. Once pages were made for each scene, they were textured into the book model. The book was animated to flip the pages of the book. I created the animation for the page flip. Once the storybook was completed, students were to animate all models based off the story.
